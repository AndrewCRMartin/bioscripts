bioscripts - installation information

INSTALLATION

Installation places the scripts in a specified directory and then
makes links in a binary directory with no extension (so you can just
type commands such as "grabpdb")

Edit the Makefile to modify 
   "dest" - where the scripts will live
   "bin"  - your binary directory (in your path)
The defaults are sensible

Type:
   make install
to install the scripts.

PREREQUISITES

You need to install the following Perl modules:
   LWP::UserAgent
Fedora/RedHat/CentOS installs this automatically. Otherwise (as root)
do: 
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   install LWP::UserAgent
